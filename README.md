For the database structure, you can design tables for userprofile, visitrecord, and likerecord. Here's a simple schema:

    userprofile Table:
        id (Primary Key)
        name
        age
        (Other relevant user profile information)

    visitrecord Table:
        id (Primary Key)
        visitor_id (Foreign Key referencing id in userprofile table)
        visited_id (Foreign Key referencing id in userprofile table)
        visit_time
        (Other relevant visit information)

    likerecord Table:
        id (Primary Key)
        user_id (Foreign Key referencing id in userprofile table)
        liked_user_id (Foreign Key referencing id in userprofile table)
        like_time
        (Other relevant like information)

With this structure, you can track profile visits and user likes efficiently.

SQL query to retrieve all profile visitors of a user, sorted by the most appropriate criteria (let's say by visit timestamp):

    SELECT u.id, u.name
        FROM userprofile u
        JOIN visitrecord v ON u.id = v.visitor_id 
        WHERE v.visited_id = [User's ID]
        ORDER BY v.visit_time DESC;
